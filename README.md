## What It Does

Our project is a bot that automatically scrapes and analyzes messages sent on the Discord messaging platform. The bot will use a machine learning algorithm to detect the “sentiment”, or overall positivity or negativity, of messages sent through the platform. We will train the bot’s algorithm using datasets available online. The machine learning algorithm will use a process called word embedding which reduces every word into a multi-dimensional vector, representing the overall “profile” of the word (similar words will have similar directions and magnitudes in its vector representation). 

## Why

The purpose of this bot is to provide a platform for positive environment control. This framework could be used to direct online discussion on sites like Facebook or Twitter in a positive direction or be used by businesses to promote positive interaction between automated customer service bots and customers.
